==Install==
The current version of TLMP is for testing only, use at your own risk.

You must have the Steam version of Torchlight (v1.15). If you obtained Torchlight through other publishers this will unfortunately not work:

Download the 7z or zip from: http://code.google.com/p/tlapi/downloads/list
Extract the files into your Steam Torchlight folder:
  * i.e.: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\torchlight

Start Torchlight.

The Multiplayer will be attached when Torchlight is started.


==Uninstall==
Remove the following files/folders from your Torchlight directory:
  * winmm.dll
  * TLAPI/IngameTest0.layout
  * TLAPI/IngameTest0.layout

Note: The install contains a resources.cfg file that you should not remove, if you wish to revert it, remove the last line present dealing with the TLAPI folder.
