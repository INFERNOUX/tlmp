==Install==
The current version of TLMP is for testing only, use at your own risk.

You *must* have the Steam version of Torchlight (v1.15). If you obtained Torchlight through other publishers this will unfortunately not work.

Download the zip from: http://code.google.com/p/tlapi/downloads/list
Extract the files into your Steam Torchlight folder:
  * i.e.: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\torchlight

Start Torchlight.

The Multiplayer will be attached when Torchlight is started and you should see the Multiplayer button in the main menu.


==Uninstall==
Remove the following files/folders from your Torchlight directory:
  * winmm.dll
  * TLAPI folder
