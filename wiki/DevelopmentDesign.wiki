==Design Doc==

===Networking===
(drivehappy) Dengus brought up threading issue with network recv messages shouldn't be calling TL functions from another thread.
  * Solution: We can move this message loop, or buffer the messages, into TL's thread.

===Stability===
(drivehappy) v1.15 (r16): Broke (at least) 3 functions: MonsterProcessAI2, MonsterIdle, PlayerInitialize


===Testing===
(drivehappy) Develop a testing framework. More than likely due to the closed source nature of our target this will need be run in TL itself.
  * Compiler flag for displaying UI testing suite in game?
  * Run through a set of unit tests utilizing the hooked functions
