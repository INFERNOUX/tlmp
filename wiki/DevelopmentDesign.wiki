#summary Intended as an overview for developers to flesh out a roadmap for development. Current major issues, questions, discussion about the overall design are listed here. These are considered brainstorming and jotdowns of potential big-picture problems.

==Design Doc==

===Networking===
(drivehappy) Dengus brought up threading issue with network recv messages shouldn't be calling TL functions from another thread.
  * Solution: We can move this message loop, or buffer the messages, into TL's thread.
(drivehappy) Networking isn't currently working, I think the above was probably causing a stability issue from what I remember.

===Stability===
(drivehappy) v1.15 (r16): Broke (at least) 3 functions: MonsterProcessAI2, MonsterIdle, PlayerInitialize


===Testing===
(drivehappy) Develop a testing framework. More than likely due to the closed source nature of our target this will need be run in TL itself.
  * Compiler flag for displaying UI testing suite in game?
  * Run through a set of unit tests utilizing the hooked functions

===Gameplay===
(drivehappy) Taken from my last known list of problems (not sure of the state of these)
  * Clients aren't handing off their inventory items to the host to create.
  * Gold/HP/Mana potions aren't triggering item pickups.
  * Bridges aren't updating collision information on the client when triggered on either end.
  * Client monster models die in the air.
  * Host doesn't handle client resurrection properly.
  * Client needs to be initially forced to load into host level.
  * Object interaction needs a sync check (perhaps through a GUID - can we rely on level loads to be deterministic?).
  * Stability problems on level transfers.
