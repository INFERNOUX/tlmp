#summary Intended as an overview for developers to flesh out a roadmap for development. Current major issues, questions, discussion about the overall design are listed here. These are considered brainstorming and jotdowns of potential big-picture problems.

==Design Doc==

===Networking===
(drivehappy)
Currently the server holds a {{{list<c_entity*>}}} in TLMP::ServerEntities.
  * c_entity holds an id var
  * this id var should be common among networked TL instances

Client suppresses all entity actions at this point.
  * should we attempt to control the actual player spawn by the server as well
  * in the big-picture aspect this would work better because there's less back and forth communication
  * but... is it easily handleable by the client if there's no actual player

===Stability===
(drivehappy) Resizing the window crashes game (at least on main menu).


===Testing===
(drivehappy) Develop a testing framework. More than likely due to the closed source nature of our target this will need be run in TL itself.
  * Compiler flag for displaying UI testing suite in game?
  * Run through a set of unit tests utilizing the hooked functions

===Gameplay===
(drivehappy) Taken from my last known list of problems (these are from the original prototyped code base)
  * Clients aren't handing off their inventory items to the host to create.
  * Gold/HP/Mana potions aren't triggering item pickups.
  * Bridges aren't updating collision information on the client when triggered on either end.
  * Client monster models die in the air.
  * Host doesn't handle client resurrection properly.
  * Client needs to be initially forced to load into host level.
  * Object interaction needs a sync check (perhaps through a GUID - can we rely on level loads to be deterministic?).
  * Stability problems on level transfers.
