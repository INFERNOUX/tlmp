==Design Doc==

===Networking===
Character and Equipment Synchronization
  * Server dictates unique IDs for everything created.
  * Since the Client is creating their own player a special Server message needs to be used for setting the IDs of all the Characters and Equipment the Client sent to us.

Item handling
  * Possibly use the CItemSaveState between the CEquipment method's for loading (and assuming there's a save method) to transfer new item info?
  * Or, extract the GUID, Enchants, Gems, Sockets myself
